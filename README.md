## Overview

CONTACT is an advanced simulation program for the study of three-dimensional
frictional contact problems, such as occur between wheel and rail, in roller
bearings and in offset printing devices. It implements the theories for
rolling contact by Dr.ir. E.A.H. Vollebregt and Prof.dr.ir. J.J. Kalker of
Delft University of Technology. 

## Physics model

CONTACT is intended for concentrated contact problems:
* from given (wheel/rail) profiles, determine where contact occurs;
* identifying the size and shape of contact areas and the pressures acting;
* accounting for creepage and friction, determine the tangential surface
   stresses (tractions), and regions with adhesion and (micro-)slip;
* calculation of elastic displacements and subsurface stresses in the bodies'
   interiors;
* for stationary and instationary, rolling and sliding problems;
* with Hertzian and non-Hertzian, "smooth edged" geometries, such that the
   contact is "concentrated" in a small, almost flat part of the bodies' 
   surfaces;
* for massive homogeneous bodies of elastic and viscoelastic materials.

CONTACT aims to provide complete and detailed solutions, with a powerful
interface for integration in multi-body simulation software. The quality of
Finite Elements, at one thousandth  of the computation time needed.
